📘 **Assembly: Endgame**

_A developer-themed word-guessing game built with React + TypeScript._

Assembly: Endgame is a humorous twist on the classic word-guessing genre.
Guess the hidden word before you run out of attempts — every wrong guess eliminates a programming language (farewell Python 🪦).

Win the game and enjoy a blast of **react-confetti** 🎉.
